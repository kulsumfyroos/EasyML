    <h1>EasyML - No-Code Machine Learning Platform</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>EasyML</strong>, a platform designed to make machine learning accessible to everyone, regardless of coding experience. With EasyML, users can train and deploy machine learning models through an intuitive, no-code interface.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ“Œ Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No-Code Interface:</strong> Create, train, and evaluate machine learning models without any coding knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Customizable Training Options:</strong> Allows parameter tuning for fine control over model training.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Selection Assistance:</strong> Automatic recommendations for the best model based on your dataset and goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Import & Preprocessing:</strong> Easily upload datasets and apply preprocessing steps through the UI.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Results:</strong> View metrics and model performance in real time as training progresses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸŒŸ Why EasyML?</h2>
    <p>EasyML is built to bridge the gap between machine learning and non-technical users. The platform allows small businesses, educators, and data enthusiasts to harness the power of AI without needing extensive programming skills. Whether youâ€™re looking to make predictions, analyze patterns, or explore data, EasyML simplifies every step of the process.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure</h2>
    <pre>
    â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # UI code for the no-code interface
    â”œâ”€â”€ backend/           # API and model training logic
    â”œâ”€â”€ models/            # Pre-trained and user-trained models
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs/              # Documentation for using EasyML
    â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Project overview
    </pre>

    <h2>ðŸš€ Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Follow the setup instructions in the <a href="docs/setup-guide.md">Setup Guide</a> to start using EasyML. The guide includes steps to set up the frontend and backend, configure dependencies, and deploy locally.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ”§ How It Works</h2>
    <p>Once set up, you can start a project, upload your data, choose or tune a model, and let EasyML handle the training process. The platform provides real-time feedback and stores trained models, ready for deployment or further analysis.</p>
